            welcome to metaflop! although it's still beta and going through heavy development, you can already generate your own metafonts with the <a href="/modulator">modulator</a>, export them as otf, and take them home with you for free. check our fonts <a href="/fonts/adjuster">mf adjuster</a> and <a href="/fonts/bespoke">mf bespoke</a> and spread the word! for more infos, see our <a href="/terms">terms</a> and <a href="/faq">faq</a>. 
            <br />
            this is an open source project and you are encouraged to contribute to it: you can find our <a href="https://github.com/greyfont/" target="_blank">source code on github</a>, both for the source code of the webpage and for all the fonts.

            although the modulator will always be enriched with new metafonts, we want this platform to be used mainly for exchange, for exploring and generating fresh and playful ideas.<br /> 
            we encourage designers and artists who would like to experiment and make projects not only with us, but also on their own. send us your proposals you made using our fonts. there will be a selection after which the best ones will be published on the projects section. <br /> 
            we are proud to present the first metaflop related work: <a href="/projects/lovehate">lovehate</a> by the swiss artist christian vetter.
